\begin{frame}
\frametitle{The Importance of Top Management Commitment}
\vspace{-0.1cm}
\begin{itemize}
\item Without top management, many projects will fail.
\item Some projects have a senior manager called a \textbf{champion} who acts as a key proponent for a project.
\item Projects are part of the larger organisational environment, and many factors are out of the project manager's control.
\end{itemize}

\begin{tcolorbox}
\textbf{How Top Managers Help Project Managers Succeed}

%---------------------------------------------------------
\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Project Management Office (PMO)}
\begin{block}{Definition: \textbf{Project Management Office (PMO)}}
A \textbf{project management office (PMO)} is an organisational entity created to assist project managers in achieving project goals.
\end{block}
\vspace{0.2cm}
A \textbf{PMO} can help development standards and methodologies standards and methodologies, provide career paths for project managers, and assist project managers with training and certification.

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Project Management Office (PMO)}
\textbf{Possible Goals of a PMO}
\vspace{0.5cm}
\begin{itemize}
\item Collect, organise, and integrate project data for the entire organisation;
\item Research, develop, and share best practices in project management;
\item Develop and maintain templates, tools, standards, and methodologies;
\item Develop and provide a formal career path for project managers;
\item Provide project management consulting services;
\item Provide a structure to house project managers while then are acting in those roles or are between projects.
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

%---------------------------------------------------------
\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Developing a Project Management Methodology}
\begin{block}{Definition: \textbf{Methodology}}
A \textbf{methodology} describes how things should be done.
\end{block}
\begin{itemize}
\item The \textit{PMBOK Guide} is a methodology  and a \textbf{standard} that describes best practices for what should be done to manage a project.
\item Another project management methodology is \textbf{PRojects IN Controlled Environments (PRINCE2)}. This was originally developed for IT projects and was released in 1996 by the U.K. Office of Government.
\item \textbf{Agile} is yet another project management methodology which is used by many software development projects. This methodology focuses on iterative workflow and incremental delivery of software in short iterations.
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

%---------------------------------------------------------
\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Developing a Project Management Methodology}
\textbf{Agile Project Management}
\vspace{0.5cm}
\begin{block}{Definition: \textbf{Agile}}
Relating to or denoting a method of project management used especially for software development, that is characterised by the division of tasks into short phases of work and frequent reassessment and adaptation of plans.
\end{block}
\begin{itemize}
\item Early software development projects used a waterfall approach, where requirements were defined in detail before any software was written.
\item As the rate of change of business technology increased, this approach became unrealistic for many projects.
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

%---------------------------------------------------------
\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Developing a Project Management Methodology}
\textbf{Scrum}
\vspace{0.25cm}
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Scrum} is the leading agile development method for completing projects with a complex, innovative scope of work.
\item The term was coined in 1986 in a Harvard Business Review study that compared high-performing, cross-functional teams to the scrum formation used by rugby teams.
\end{itemize}

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Project Management Process Groups}
\begin{block}{Definition: \textbf{Process}}
A \textbf{process} is a series of actions directed towards a particular result
\end{block}
\vspace{0.5cm}
\begin{block}{Definition: \textbf{Process Groups}}
Project management \textbf{process groups} progress from initiating activities to planning activities, executing activities, monitoring and controlling activities, and closing activities.
\end{block}

\end{frame}

%----------------------------------------------------------

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Description of Process Groups}
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Initiating processes}: include actions to begin projects and project phases
\item \textbf{Planning processes}: include devising and maintaining a workable scheme to ensure that the project meets its scope, time, and cost goals as well as organisational needs
\item \textbf{Executing processes}: include coordinating people and other resources to carry out the project plans and produce the deliverables of the project or phase.
\item \textbf{Monitoring and controlling processes}: measure progress towards achieving project goals, monitor deviation from plans, and take corrective action to match progress with plans and customer expectations
\item \textbf{Closing processes}: include formalising acceptance of the project or phase and bringing it to an orderly end
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

%---------------------------------------------------------
\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Project Management Process Groups}
The process groups have clear dependencies and are performed in the same sequence on each project.
\begin{figure}
\includegraphics[scale=0.4]{process_seq}
\caption{The diagram helps to understand how the process groups are sequenced}
\end{figure}
\end{frame}

%----------------------------------------------------------
\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Characteristics of the Process Groups}
The level of activity and length of each process group varies for every project:
\begin{itemize}
\item Normally, executing tasks require the most resources and time, followed by planning tasks;
\item Monitoring and controlling processes are done throughout the project's lifespan;
\item Initiating and closing tasks are usually the shortest (at the beginning and end of a project or phase, respectively), and they require the least amount of resources and time.
\end{itemize}
Note that process groups apply to the entire project as well as to the project phases.
\vspace{0.5cm}
\begin{block}{Definition: \textbf{Phase}}
A \textbf{phase} is a distinct stage in project development, and most projects have distinct phases.
\end{block}
\end{frame}

\frametitle{What Happens Prior to the Initiating Process?}
\textbf{Pre-initiating Processes}\\
\vspace{0.5cm}
It is good practice to lay the groundwork for a project before it officially starts. After a project is approved, senior managers should meet to accomplish the following tasks:
\vspace{0.5cm}
\begin{itemize}
\item Determine the scope time, and cost \textbf{constraints} for the project;
\item Identify the \textbf{project sponsor};
\item Select the \textbf{project manager};
\item Meet with the project manager to review the process and expectations for managing the project;
\item Determine if the project should be divided into two or more smaller projects because it is easier to manage smaller projects than larger ones.
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

%----------------------------------------------------------
\begin{frame}
\frametitle{What Happens Prior to the Initiating Process?}
\textbf{Business Case}\\
\vspace{0.5cm}
A \textbf{business case} is just a document that provides financial justification for investing in a project. Typically a \textbf{business case} will contain:
\begin{itemize}
\item Introduction and background
\item Business Objective
\item Current situation and problem/opportunity statement
\item Critical assumptions and constraints
\item Analysis of options and recommendation
\item Preliminary project requirements
\item Budget estimate and financial analysis
\item Schedule estimate
\item Potential risks
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Creating a Project Charter}
\vspace{0.25cm}
\begin{block}{Definition: \textbf{Project Charter}}
A \textbf{project charter} is a document that formally recognises the existence of a project and provides a summary of the project's objectives and management
\end{block}
\vspace{0.25cm}
\begin{itemize}
\item A project charter authorises the project manager to use organisational resources to complete the project;
\item The project manager plays a major role in developing the project charter;
\item A crucial part of the project charter is the sign off section.
\item Instead of project charters, some organisations initiate projects using a simple letter of agreement or formal contracts
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

%----------------------------------------------------------
\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Project Charter}
\textbf{Contents of a Project Charter}
\vspace{0.5cm}
\begin{itemize}

\frametitle{Identifying Stakeholders}
Recall that \textbf{project stakeholders}, can be positive or negative, and are the people involved in or affected by project activities. Stakeholders can be classified as \textbf{internal} of \textbf{external}:
\vspace{0.5cm}
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Internal project stakeholders} generally include the project sponsor, project team, support staff, and internal customers for the project.
\item \textbf{External project stakeholders} include the project's customers (if they are external to the organisation), competitors, suppliers, and other external groups that are potentially involved in or affected by the project, such as government officials and concerned citizens.
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\textbf{Stakeholder Register and Stakeholder Analysis}\\
\vspace{0.5cm}
The task of identifying stakeholders can be broken down into two subtasks: creating a \textbf{stakeholder register}, and performing \textbf{stakeholder analysis}.
\vspace{0.5cm}
\begin{block}{Definition: \textbf{Stakeholder Register}}
A \textbf{stakeholder register} is a document that includes details related to the identified project stakeholders - usually available to many people, so it should not include sensitive information
\end{block}
\vspace{0.2cm}
\begin{block}{Definition: \textbf{Stakeholder Analysis}}
A \textbf{stakeholder analysis} is a technique for analysing information to determine which stakeholders' interests to focus on and how to increase stakeholder support throughout the project.
\end{block}
\end{frame}

%----------------------------------------------------------
\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Identifying Stakeholders}

%----------------------------------------------------------
\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Identifying Stakeholders}
\textbf{What should a stakeholder analysis include?}
\vspace{0.5cm}
\begin{itemize}
\item Names and organisations of key stakeholders
\item Their roles on the project
\item Unique facts about each stakeholder
\item Their levels of interest in the project
\item Their influence on the project
\item Suggestions for managing relationships with each stakeholder

%----------------------------------------------------------
\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Identifying Stakeholders}
\textbf{Categorising Engagement Levels of Stakeholders}\\
\vspace{0.5cm}
Stakeholders' level of engagement is typically identified as one of the following:
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Unaware}: unaware of the project and its potential impacts on them.
\item \textbf{Resistant}: aware of the project yet resistant to change.
\item \textbf{Neutral}: aware of the project yet neither supportive nor resistant
\item \textbf{Supportive}: aware of the project and supportive of change.
\item \textbf{Leading}: aware of the project and its potential impacts and actively engaged in helping it succeed.
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

%----------------------------------------------------------
\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Holding a Project Kickoff Meeting}
\begin{block}{Definition: \textbf{Kick-off Meeting}}
A \textbf{kick-off meeting} is a meeting held at the beginning of a project so that stakeholders can meet each other, review the goals of the project, and discuss future plans.
\end{block}

\begin{itemize}
\item Experienced project managers know that it is crucial to get projects off to a great start
\item Often \textbf{kick-off meetings} are used to get support for a project and clarify roles and responsibilities
\item The project champion should speak first and introduce the project sponsor and project manager
\item Often a fair amount of work is done to prepare for the meeting
\item Kick-off meetings are held face to face
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}
